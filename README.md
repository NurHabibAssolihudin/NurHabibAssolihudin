### 🎯 Who I Am

> **“Life is not just about being born and dying.”**  
> It’s about *feeling*, *failing*, *fighting*, and *finding* meaning.  
> I live once — and I choose to make it unforgettable.

I’m **Nur**, a back-end engineer with a soul of an artist.  
My ambition is to create something real — logic that evokes emotion.  
I love building **interactive games** and **ai systems** — tools that reflect human struggle, creativity, and precision.
